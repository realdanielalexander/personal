## I Graduated University — A Reminder to Keep Going

![i-graduated-university-a-reminder-to-keep-going](/images/i-graduated-university-a-reminder-to-keep-going.jpg)

Growing up, I had no particular talent. I was just a mediocre, awful looking nerd. I had no real friends. In school, I got bullied, a lot. I still remember finding my textbook in the dumpster after a dude hid it during lunch break. I got left out from group assignments. My grades were okay though, only because I felt the need to pass classes, even though I hated the subjects. My self esteem were low and I dreaded going to school overall.

For the longest time I wanted to be good at something. I wanted to feel good about myself, I wanted to feel a sense of accomplishment. I started picking up the guitar, and since then music has been one of my ways to express myself. I haven’t been socially adept, My way to express my feelings were through computers, video games, and music. Fast forward to senior year of high school, I was preparing for a college admission exam. And then came exam day and to my surprise, I wasn’t able to solve a single problem on the exam. I felt that my efforts was useless, but quickly realized that my study method was wrong, but it was all too late.

Long story short, I was admitted to a private university to study computer science. That was the first time that I actually wanted to pursue something in life. I had a plan to graduate early and get a job in tech, so I spent most of my time in the library, doing practice problems and coding assignments. For the first time, I actually felt proud of my work. I went on to participate in coding bootcamps, competitions, and internships. I had one goal to succeed academically.

When the pandemic hit, I felt stagnant. Staying at home for almost a year made me unproductive. I had no motivation to do anything and professor saw me as a failure, told me off, and my plan to graduate early were cancelled. I was used as a bad example for the other students.

But I remembered that I was once in a similar, if not worse position. I believed that this was my reminder to keep going, to keep on improving and look for opportunities. I applied for a scholarship and got admitted to study abroad in the US. That was the first time I lived far from home. I grew significantly as a person. Having to speak in a foreign language and getting immersed in another culture made me embrace change even more. I realized that life is more than just academic and professional achievements, it’s how you interact with others and embracing the little things that made you who you are.

Recently, I finished my studies and graduated, got a job in tech, and was invited to present my paper in an international conference.

I am still far from my definition of success but one thing that I want you to remember is to keep pushing forward and to keep going in face of challenges. I know the fact that my version of myself today is better than who I was a year back. I took opportunities, got rejected, got told off a million times, but I knew the risk and I don’t regret a single thing. I’m a firm believer that life is too short to wait around and this also applies to other facets of life.
