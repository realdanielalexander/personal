# Studying Abroad — My Experience

It was May 2021, I was just about to finish my sixth semester. I was in my third year, or a junior as they would say in the US, studying Informatics at a well-known private university in Bandung, Indonesia. Wrapping up my fourth online semester, I felt empty and in need of a change. After three years of studying, doing problem sets and building different technologies, I didn't really feel the spark that I once had in my freshman year when I first got admitted to college. My education experience hasn't been the smoothest. In fact, I wasn't the best student in high school and I planned to graduate college earlier as I was intrigued by computers and wanted to prove myself that I can succeed in this field. However, things changed and my graduation was postponed to follow the regular curriculum timeline. The expression of “being in the right place at the right time” resonated with my situation at the time. I saw an opportunity for a scholarship that opened applications for third and fourth year students to study abroad. Indonesian International Student Mobility Awards is the Government of Indonesia scholarship scheme to fund Indonesian students for mobility program at top universities overseas. Had I graduated earlier, I wouldn't even have the chance to apply. The short two-week selection process felt like the longest two weeks in my life. I found myself locked up in my room day in day out trying to come up with strategies to pass the selection processes.

The jet-lag quickly went away with all the activities as it was halfway through New Student Orientation (NSO) when I arrived. First month in, everything still felt surreal to me. I still haven't gotten over how life could be so different miles away from home. Seemingly mundane activities like going to classes and grabbing dinner from the dining halls gets me excited and I look forward to living each and every day. I lived in Rodin College House, one of the three high rises. As someone who has never lived on-campus before, being able to see people my age everyday down the hallway or in the common areas was something new as I have spent the last 21 years of my life living at home.

The classes I took were interactive, in a sense that we had someone to talk to for each meeting. I was surprised by how most of the classes follow a discussion format, something very different from what I was used to. However, I had trouble voicing my ideas and opinions early in the semester, especially in a classroom setting where everybody is listening and you have to make somewhat sound arguments. Hell, I couldn't even carry a basic conversation in my first month. I tried my best to keep up with native English speaker friends, and I think that was the most important thing, to try. Exposing yourself to as much learning opportunities and keep an open mind to criticism gets you a long way when studying abroad. I was very lucky to be surrounded by people who were very understanding and the support that they gave me were immensely helpful. My friends helped me proofread my assignments and I still save copies of them with the comments to improve my writing. I also had very supportive classmates when I gave presentations in front of the class. I am not the most outspoken person, but by being genuinely honest and interested in people, I was able to make friends that I still talk to today.

Next two months, I started to settle in. I got more comfortable meeting new people and getting immersed, even though I still have to introduce myself dozens of time each day (don't get me wrong, I really liked doing this haha). I kind of got the gist of what being a Penn student was like, with late nights and early mornings walking down Locust Walk and ordering food from Wawa. It almost felt like I lived there. Writing essays and speaking up in class felt gradually easier as my English brain started to get primed. Travelling places that I had only seen in movies and pictures was one of the highlights of my experience. In total, I visited a total of 5 states outside Pennsylvania, spanned across four months: New York, Florida, California, Massachusetts and Washington DC, though I've only learned that Washington DC is not a state. It's amazing to be physically present in places from movies and video games that I grew up with.
