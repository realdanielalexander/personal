## About

I’m a Master’s student in Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania, working on systems for machine learning. I’m applying to PhD programs for Fall 2026 and enjoy discussions around distributed systems and ML infrastructure.

## Research Interests

My research interests include distributed systems for machine learning, with a focus on large language model (LLM) serving, GPU scheduling, and system-level techniques for improving performance, efficiency, and resource utilization.

## Current Work

I am currently working with Prof. Vincent Liu on developing techniques to accelerate LLM serving systems through dynamic scheduling and execution strategies.
