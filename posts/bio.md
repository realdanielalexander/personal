## About

Hello! I’m Daniel, a Master’s student in Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania.

I am currently working with Prof. Vincent Liu in the Distributed Systems Lab on techniques to accelerate LLM serving systems through dynamic scheduling strategies. My research focuses on systems for emerging workloads, particularly at the intersection of large-scale machine learning and systems design. Over the years, I have developed strong experience in both research and engineering for complex systems problems. Prior to Penn, I worked as a software engineer on the ShopeePay core team at Shopee. I received my bachelor’s degree from Harapan Bangsa Institute of Technology in Indonesia.

I’m **actively seeking PhD opportunities in computer systems for Fall 2026**. My research interests span systems-for-ML, ML-for-systems, datacenter computing, operating systems, storage systems, distributed systems, and databases.
