# Revising my own IISMA Essay

This is an essay I wrote in 2021 that got me the Indonesian International Student Mobility Awards (IISMA) scholarship. I will try to break down my thought process in writing this essay as well as what I would have done differently. Keep in mind that there is no guarantee that following this framework of essay will get you the results that you wanted, this is merely my personal reflection on the topic.

## Discuss your past academic achievements, including the process and skills involved in your previous or current degree program!

> Throughout my five semesters of studying Informatics, I have had the opportunity to take part in activities that have helped me hone both my technical programming and soft skills. In my first year, I had the honor to represent my university in the UNIBI Technology Competition to represent Sundanese culture digitally and was awarded first place. At university, I was actively involved in my campus’ student council called Informatics Engineering Community in the publications division. I was also active as an assistant lecturer where I taught a class of approximately fifty undergraduate students. During the summer break, I took part in the Web Intelligence Data Mining lab as a research assistant. Last year, I got the opportunity to join Bangkit Academy, a machine learning academy led by Google with 300 other students from all across Indonesia. There, I studied machine learning and built an app project called Ingredients Detection with two colleagues from a different university, which was selected as one of the best projects from the four city cohorts. My perseverance and passion for computer science has led me to receive a GPA of 3.99 out of 4.00 and nominated for Dean’s List for five consecutive semesters.

This paragraph only gave a shopping list of my achievements without giving contexts and backgrounds. I would start by adding the reasoning behind taking on each programs.

Before

> In my first year, I had the honor to represent my university in the UNIBI Technology Competition to represent Sundanese culture digitally and was awarded first place.

After

> Being born and raised in Bandung, I decided to preserve my cultural roots through attending the UNIBI Technology Competition in which I created a Sundanese culture themed website and was awarded first place.

There is no description of what I did in the student council, so adding a job description would highlight the projects and skills involved

Before

> At university, I was actively involved in my campus’ student council called Informatics Engineering Community in the publications division.

After

> The student council called Informatics Engineering Community was where I spent most of my time after class, designing posters to drive up the number of event participants.

There is no overarching theme of what I was trying to achieve in my studies. In reality, I was gravitated towards being a researcher for computer graphics and vision. The wording in the next two sentences could be compressed to reflect this desire.

After

> In the following semester, I built the Ingredients Detection and Recipe Recommendation app, which won the best capstone project from 300 other participants of Bangkit Academy. My interest for research in machine learning was further stimulated when I researched machine learning methods in the Web Intelligence and Data Mining Laboratory.

Here's the full complete paragraph after revision.

## Please outline your plans to engage with local and international communities during IISMA program using clear examples!

> Firstly, upon arriving at University of Pennsylvania, I am going to sign up for the Indonesian student association called PENNCASILA to learn the differences in culture between Indonesian and American students. I will join the Penn Student Government (PSG) which regularly schedules networking events with guest speakers from different backgrounds. Currently, there are more than 450 student organizations ranging from intellectual, artistic, cultural, social, and recreational communities at Penn and I am going to also be involved in as many volunteering opportunities and academic clubs as possible around the campus. The Netter Center for Community Partnerships also provides many ways for students to get involved. On a daily basis after every lecture, I will introduce myself and connect with the professors and classmates who happen to be taking the same class. The average engineering class size is 30 students so I will be able to get to know them all. I am particularly interested in visiting the Computer Science department to get to know the professors to talk about their research problems and their master’s program for further studies. Engaging in these communities will broaden my global connections and knowledge even after returning to Indonesia.

Overall, this paragraph already reflects most of my plans, but could be worded better. I would remove some connecting words and add segues from one sentences to another.

Discuss a time when you faced a difficult academic challenge or hurdle and how you navigated through it!

> Recently around the start of 2020, when all activities were suddenly moved online, I was not accustomed to the amount of workload and I had a hard time focusing on online classes. The lack of social interaction made me anxious every time there was a deadline. I was also enrolled in Bangkit so it was tough to balance between the two and I quickly figured that I needed to adapt quickly. In Bangkit, we had to create a full machine learning application in only one month and one of our team members was inactive, so I took the initiative to redistribute the work and schedule meetings everyday. I used Google Calendar to time-block meetings and activities synced across accounts and I curated resources from Coursera and Udemy for my colleagues to learn from. I started getting back on my feet in my studies and we made quick progress on the project. During the project, we were constantly brainstorming ideas and we presented our project to industry expert panelists on showcase day, which really boosted my communication and collaboration skills. After a lot of hard work, our project was selected as one of the best from the four city cohorts.

Although this is another pandemic pity party story, this paragraph uses the STAR method (situation, task, action, results) in a great way, describing the skills involved in each stage. Here’s the breakdown:

**Situation**: There was a pandemic and social interactions were limited

**Task**: I needed to build an app in Bangkit Academy

**Action**: I redistributed the work and curated online learning resources

**Results**: The project was awarded best capstone project

I also changed the structure and wording for some sentences.

How will this program (Merdeka Belajar Kampus Merdeka and IISMA program in particular) help you to achieve your immediate goals and how can you contribute back to this program?

> Being born and raised in Bandung, I haven’t had the chance to experience different cultural settings other than the one in my hometown. Throughout my study of computer science, I often feel that the world is changing rapidly and I’m not part of it. IISMA will bridge that gap and help me understand the culture and impacts on society behind the technology and the rapid globalization that I’m studying. Going into my final year, I have already worked through half of my thesis which is a research in the field of Computer Vision for Autonomous Vehicles and the courses that I’m taking in IISMA are very crucial complements to it. Enrolling at UPenn would open up opportunities to connect with like-minded people because UPenn is one of the world’s top research universities and I hope to pursue my master’s degree there. Upon returning to Indonesia, I will have new ideas, connections, and experiences to share. I plan to contribute to my home university by proposing a cooperation in the form of mentoring and online classes with UPenn. After graduating, I plan to pursue a tech career and become a researcher to speed up the commercialization of autonomous vehicles in Indonesia.

The first two sentences really bragged about my shortcomings, which could be revised by focusing on the initiative actions rather than the lack of resources.

After

> Studying computer science requires the resources, facilities, and awareness of its impact on society, all of which I have been actively seeking throughout my undergraduate studies.

I changed the wording in some sentences and made clear the overarching goal at the end of the paragraph
